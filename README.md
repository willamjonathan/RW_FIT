  FIT moto: Your healthy solution.<br>
  Fit is a mobile phone and I used 413 px * 896 px as the standard size of the app, therefore ;
  Please set the your screen to 413 px * 896 px ( If you are using pc, you can use developer tools ). <br>
  Besides that, I also found a problem when using developer tools which is:<br>
  </t>-The cursor become rounded and my code for changing the cursor doesn't work.<br>
  </t>-The hover shadow box doesn't work too.<br>
